# Install ZSH and configure it.


1. sudo apt-get install zsh
2. Checkout Autosuggestion repo -> https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md
3. git clone git@github.com:zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
4. Edit ~/.zshrc file with the following line source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
- make sure the path is correct ! mine is 'source ~/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh'
